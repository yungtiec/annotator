<ul>
<li>
<strong>Completeness</strong>: Does the project describe its complete approach to the relevant topic? Are all facts on the table or are some important pieces of information missing?</li>
<li>
<strong>Clarity</strong>: Are the disclosures easy to understand? Consumer tokens can be complex, so it is important to consider how easy it is to comprehend the information being disseminated.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consistency</strong>: Does the project describe its approach consistently, or are there conflicting pieces of information that could lead to confusion about the project’s approach?</li>
</ul>
<p>Judged on these factors, the following scores and symbols are assigned within the scorecard to indicate the quality of relevant statements for each topic.</p>
