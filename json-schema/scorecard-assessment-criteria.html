<p>The transparency score is a reflection of the following three factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Does the project describe its complete approach to the relevant topic? Are all facts on the table or are some important pieces of information missing?</li><li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Are the disclosures easy to understand? Consumer tokens can be complex, so it is important to consider how easy it is to comprehend the information being disseminated.</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Does the project describe its approach consistently, or are there conflicting pieces of information that could lead to confusion about the projectâ€™s approach?</li></ul><p>Judged on these factors, the following scores and symbols are assigned within the scorecard to indicate the quality of relevant statements for each topic.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">score</th><th style="text-align: left;">assessment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left;">-</td><td style="text-align: left;">Not applicable.
