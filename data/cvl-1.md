# Civil - BKP Framework - Principle 1

### Description of the token’s intrinsic features and operation.

- The Civil Media Company writes that “CVL, which is based on the ERC20 protocol . . . is a value stored in a decentralized database that’s managed by Civil’s smart contract, which allows the Civil platform to interact with the CVL token”. The token “unlocks two vital business features for journalists: self-governance and permanence”. 

- Importantly, while Civil is an open platform, the ownership of the CVL token does award additional consumptive privileges to the holder. This is illustrated through the waterline concept - CVL holders are “Community Members” who “help govern the platform”. 

- Civil explains that ownership of CVL constitutes voting rights to key decisions in the governance of the network. It does not, however, liken ownership of CVL to equity ownership, an interest in a fund, access to passive-earned dividend income, or other characteristics of a financial instrument.

### Classification of the token under The Brooklyn Project Token Taxonomy and applicable law. 

- The Brooklyn Project Token Taxonomy lays out three higher level classifications for crypto tokens: general payment tokens, consumer tokens, and investment tokens. General payment tokens are those whose primary activity is the general store and transfer of value. Consumer tokens transfer consumptive rights to holders, such ownership of a particular good or service, a coupon on the price of a real or digital asset, or the right to participate in a given activity. Investment tokens are financial investments classified as securities. 

- Civil has classified their token as an ERC20 token, but has not yet disclosed their BP Taxonomy classification. Ostensibly, Civil’s CVL token would fall under the Activity classification of a Consumer Token. Through allowing CVL to serve as payment on the Civil network, the token confers the rights to a “Reward” activity. Through the implementation of a staking mechanism to publish and challenge content, the token confers the rights to a “License” activity.
