# Third-party assessment

### Project strengths

- VP has exceptional connections and partnerships set up in both the poker sphere (such as Phil Ivey) and the development sphere (as a Consensys project).

- VP plans to enter a growing market with a clear strategy for differentiation which would genuinely deliver value to players (more security) if successful.

- The team’s depth and breadth of software expertise lowers the technical execution risk.

- Signs of informed ICO planning (ERC223 coin, founder stake vested, reasonable caps).

### Project risks
- VP’s current following is relatively small, and their platform’s success is dependent on them establishing a substantial user base and gameplay volume.

- Blockchain software may not effective at addressing current online poker security flaws or may be open to flaws of its own.

- Accounts caught cheating can’t have transactions reversed to claw back funds unless there is a fork in the blockchain - they can only be banned.

- As it is built on the Ethereum platform, VP activity is tied to gas price and Ethereum network usage + development.

### Outstanding questions
- How does Virtue Poker plan to capture users who are unaware of blockchain and don’t understand the possible benefits it could deliver?

- Assuming no investment demand at all, and only transaction demand for  Virtue Poker gameplay and justice staking, what level of gameplay volume would translate to a breakeven for Virtue Poker?

- Given that poker is a fairly commoditized service, how does Virtue Poker plan to differentiate itself from other blockchain poker companies?
