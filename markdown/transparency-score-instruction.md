Fill out the form for each principle following the instructions outlined here:

###### **a.** Calculate transparency scores between 1 and 10 based on these metrics:

- **Completeness**: Does the project describe its complete approach to the relevant topic? Are all facts on the table or are some important pieces of information missing?
- **Clarity**: Are the disclosures easy to understand? Consumer tokens can be complex, so it is important to consider how easy it is to comprehend the information being disseminated.
- **Consistency**: Does the project describe its approach consistently, or are there conflicting pieces of information that could lead to confusion about the project’s approach?

Judged on these factors, the following scores and symbols are assigned within the scorecard to indicate the quality of relevant statements for each topic.

| score | assessment                                                   |
| :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| -     | Not applicable. Not applicable at the time of assessment.    |
| 1-2   | Red flag. Disclosures are non-existent or contain directly conflicting information. |
| 3-4   | Poor. Disclosures fail to reveal any useful information.     |
| 5-6   | Present but lacking. Disclosures are only partially complete or lacking in clarity or completeness. |
| 7-8   | Good. Disclosures meet standards, but have room for improvement. |
| 9-10  | Very good. Disclosures are complete, clear, easy to understand and consistent. |

###### **b.** For each disclosure, indicate under the “Status” column whether the disclosure has been provided (✓) or whether it is missing,  incomplete or unclear (X). Include the source of each disclosure in the “Source” column.

###### **c.** We suggest that reviewers describe the disclosures and analyze the adherence to the Framework. A few guiding questions have been provided for each Principle to help you carry out this exercise.
