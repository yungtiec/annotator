# Civil (CVL) Transparency Scorecard

### Summary

This scorecard attempts to assess the quality of Civil’s statements and documentation based on the Transparency Goals outlined in The Brooklyn Project’s [Consumer Token Framework](https://framework.thebkp.com/). This assessment focuses on the completeness, clarity and consistency of the disclosures; it does not attempt to opine on the veracity of the disclosures or the merits or substance of the practices described. We invite you and the community to participate in verifying and diligencing these disclosures with us.



### LEGAL NOTICE - MUST BE READ PRIOR TO USE

**This document should be viewed as starting a conversation to help improve the transparency of projects. This document does not create an attorney-client relationship or privilege with or among anyone, and no one should rely on this document as legal advice. Likewise, this document is not the final authority on what Civil and its associated persons have said or will say about any particular topic. If you are interested in purchasing CVL tokens, you must conduct your own due diligence and analysis of CVL tokens to determine if they are appropriate for you.**



### Scorecard

The transparency score is a reflection of the following three factors:

- **Completeness**: Does the project describe its complete approach to the relevant topic? Are all facts on the table or are some important pieces of information missing?
- **Clarity**: Are the disclosures easy to understand? Consumer tokens can be complex, so it is important to consider how easy it is to comprehend the information being disseminated.
- **Consistency**: Does the project describe its approach consistently, or are there conflicting pieces of information that could lead to confusion about the project’s approach?

Judged on these factors, the following scores and symbols are assigned within the scorecard to indicate the quality of relevant statements for each topic.

| score | assessment                                                   |
| :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| -     | Not applicable. Not applicable at the time of assessment.    |
| 1-2   | Red flag. Disclosures are non-existent or contain directly conflicting information. |
| 3-4   | Poor. Disclosures fail to reveal any useful information.     |
| 5-6   | Present but lacking. Disclosures are only partially complete or lacking in clarity or completeness. |
| 7-8   | Good. Disclosures meet standards, but have room for improvement. |
| 9-10  | Very good. Disclosures are complete, clear, easy to understand and consistent. |

### Principle 1: Consumer Token Design

##### Transparency score: 9/10

##### Analysis:

Civil’s CVL token’s design fits within the parameters described in Principle 1 of the Framework. The token does not display financial characteristics, such as equity ownership, a predominant interest in a fund, or passive-earned dividend rights. The token offers the right to participate in curating newsrooms that are following the Civil Constitution via the Civil Registry.

The CVL token unlocks two key business features for journalists: self-governance and permanence. As individual token holders are responsible for curating the Civil Registry of Civil newsrooms, the system is self-governing. Through the use of the Ethereum blockchain, information on the platform achieves permanence.

Within The Brooklyn Project’s Token Taxonomy, CVL would be considered a consumer token. Through the implementation of a staking mechanism to become or challenge a Civil newsroom, the token confers rights to a “License” activity by allowing holders of CVL to participate in the operation of the Civil Registry. Because the Civil Registry distributes (or redistributes) CVL to successful participants in the Registry, CVL tokens also confer rights to a “Reward” activity.



### Principle 2: Project Governance and Operation

##### Transparency score: 10/10

##### Analysis:

The Civil Registry will allow self-governance and token-curation of a whitelist of newsrooms that are following the Civil Constitution. The Registry will be curated by CVL token holders. CVL will be staked in whitelist applications and challenges, as well as used for voting. CVL token holders, referred to as Community Members in the Whitepaper, have governance rights insofar as their token ownership confers them. The specific rights of token holders are explored in Principle 9 of this scorecard.

The project will be governed by six bodies:

- **Civil Foundation** will be an independent non-profit organization established to house the Civil Council’s voting members and ensure the Civil Constitution is upheld.
- **Civil Newsroom Mutual** will be a media liability insurance company cooperatively owned by newsrooms.

- **Civil Media Company**: The founding for-profit entity of Civil has three mandates:
  1. Serve the mission, values and ethos of Civil as thought leaders for the ecosystem;
  2. Develop new and innovative uses for blockchain and cryptoeconomics;
  3. Scale and optimize our marketplace businesses.
- **Civil Studio**: a for-profit entity to pilot marquee works of journalism, “acting as a producer investing for upside and providing high-level support but not directly involved in the legwork”.
- **Civil Council** will serve as an independent, nonprofit, final arbiter in disputes that cannot come to a crowd-governed solution.
- **Civil Labs**: a for-profit entity designed to develop “software apps, tools, and widgets for the Civil ecosystem” and eventually maintain a consumer and enterprise app store.

In addition, the Civil Constitution will be a serve as a foundational charter, prescribing the principles by which Civil is to be governed and grown. While not technically a governing body, the document will have influence on each individual governing body and serve as a resource for conflict resolution. This document can be updated by the Civil community over time.

The full leadership of the Civil Media Company is disclosed in the “Who’s Behind Civil” section of the Whitepaper, where the names, roles and backgrounds of select members of the project are posted. A higher level summary of the key leadership related to the CVL token is offered below:

- __Matthew Iles, CEO__, studied journalism at Duke before pursuing a career of digital marketing and business modeling.
- __Lillian Ruiz, Growth and Operations Lead__, has 9 years of experience in digital marketing, audience development and business strategy, previously at InsideHook.
- __Dan Kinsley, Engineering Lead__, has over 10 years of experience in launching and scaling early stage businesses and systems, such as Surf and Fuze.
- __Nguyet Vuong, Product Design Lead__, has over 10 years of experience in design and digital launch, previously working for the Atlantic’s creative agency in DC.
- __Matt Coolidge, Marketing Lead__, has over 10 years of experience in public relations and lobbying, previously working for Bateman Group.
- __Vivian Schiller, CEO, Civil Foundation__ has more than three decades of journalism experience. She was previously president and CEO at National Public Radio, former head of news and journalism partnerships at Twitter and chief digital officer at NBC News.

A timeline indicating estimated dates for previous milestones and future roadmap items is featured on the Civil project page of the Token Foundry website. Milestones include a ConsenSys partnership announcement and publication of the Civil Constitution and Whitepaper. Future items include the CVL token sale and the Civil platform launch. It is noted that all dates are estimations subject to change.

The publishing, challenging, and curation of content are all decentralized. Newsrooms are independent of each other and of the Civil Media Company, and newsrooms choose what to publish. The challenge system subjects all published content to scrutinous wisdom of the crowd, in that there is an incentive for successfully correcting incorrect or misleading information.

Conflict resolution is first attempted through decentralized methods, such as crowd-governance guided by the “Civil Constitution”. If a conflict cannot come to a crowd-mediated solution, the Civil Council can render a judgement in an appeal, but even that judgment can be overturned by a sufficient number of CVL holders.

The various organizational units in the ecosystem are not directly related and other companies and individuals are free to enter the ecosystem, serving as a large-scale level of decentralization. The Civil Registry and CVL token software will be open source and, thus, “forkable.” Civil Media Company invites developers to build complementary apps and offerings on top of the network. For example, it will be possible to “fork” the Registry or to build various user interfaces, tools, or services that utilize CVL or are available to newsrooms on the Registry.



### Principle 3: Responsible Token Distribution

##### Analysis:

Civil Media Company will sell the initial CVL tokens through Token Foundry and contribute the proceeds of the planned token sale to the Civil Foundation to fuel grants for worthy journalism projects.

The sale will use an assessment test to determine eligibility to purchase tokens based on:

- Intent to use or consume CVL through use on the platform.
- Reasonable understanding of the functions of CVL and its underlying technology.
- A risk profile consistent with purchasing this type of product.

Tokens allocated to founding Council members will have a two year restriction. If, after one year, Constitutional proposals put forward by the Council are ratified, 50% of these tokens will become unrestricted. If such proposals are ratified by the end of the second year from launch, 100% of the tokens will become unrestricted. In the event that proposals fail to pass, voting members will be terminated from the Council, with their tokens rescinded and reverted back to the Civil Media Company. However, past the Council, the lockups and vesting schedules for other token allocations are not disclosed.

The Token Foundry registration process for the CVL sale requires users to attest that they “understand that nobody (including but not limited to anyone associated with the CVL token, the Civil Network, or the CVL token sale) is obligated to, or responsible for, creating any type of financial return for you in association with your purchase of CVL tokens.”

The CVL terms of sale requires each user to attest that it is “acquiring CVL tokens solely for use in connection with the Platform and is not acquiring CVL tokens for any other purposes, including, but not limited to, any investment, speculative or other financial purposes.”

Transferability and resale of CVL tokens will be restricted for at least one year following the token sale. Specifically, before each purchaser in the token sale can transfer or resell any CVL tokens, they will be required to ‘prove use’ of a portion of the tokens they purchase. Purchasers of less than $10,000 must use at least 25% of their tokens; purchasers of more than $10,000 must use at least 50% of their tokens.

Even after a purchaser proves use, for at least one year following the token sale, he or she can only resell tokens to “attested consumers” -- i.e., other people who successfully registered as such through Token Foundry or who otherwise successfully answer questions on the Civil website proving they understand how CVL tokens are used and that they actually intend to use the CVL tokens for their intended purpose.



### Principle 4: Purpose of Token Distribution

##### Transparency score: 8/10

##### Analysis:

Civil Media Company will contribute the proceeds of the planned token sale to the Civil Foundation to fund grants for worthy journalism projects. The Civil Media Company will retain 33% of the CVL token supply for compensatory and reserve purposes.

The token sale proceeds and regular updates on the use of funds will not be applicable until the token distribution.



### Principle 5: Token Supply

##### Transparency score: 8/10

##### Analysis:

The total token supply will be 100,000,000 CVL. No additional CVL will be created.

In the initial public sale commencing September 2018, 34% of the total token supply, a total of 34,000,000 CVL tokens, will be sold to public purchasers who demonstrate an understanding of and intent to use the token.

The remaining token supply is explained as follows: “The Civil Media Company will retain 33% of the CVL token supply for compensatory and reserve purposes. The remaining 33% of the CVL token supply will be sold or granted to mission-aligned, third-party partner organizations (think: media companies, journalism schools, technology companies that wish to help build out Civil’s discovery/sharing/discourse ecosystem).” It is not clear what plans, timelines, or restrictions will apply for the use, release, or potential circulation of these tokens.



### Principle 6: Mitigation of Conflicts and Improper Trading

###### Transparency score: 10/10

| Disclosure                                    |                            Status                            | Source                                                       |

##### Analysis:

Most conflicts on the platform will be handled through a crowd-governance system under the guidance of the Civil Constitution. Conflicts that cannot be solved through crowd governance may be appealed to the Civil Council.

It is important to note that all content published on Civil is owned by the journalists themselves, rather than the Civil Media Company. Additionally, the publication of news pieces on the Ethereum blockchain offers a reasonable guarantee of permanence for any published information.

There will be an initial filter in the planned token sale, limiting access to individuals wishing to use the token for improper trading. The qualifications assessed by this filter are described in Principle 3.

Conflicts of interest between the Civil team and other stakeholders are not directly addressed in the Whitepaper.

##### Statement from Civil:

In response to “Steps to identify, manage, mitigate conflicts,” Civil Media Company will work with its attorneys to implement policies to prevent employees from engaging in improper business dealings and token trading.



### Principle 7: Token Safety and Security

##### Transparency score: 10/10

##### Analysis:

A report of the independent technological audit(s) of the token and related code is not yet available.

As for mechanisms for notifying users of security vulnerabilities, the code being open source lends itself to public scrutiny and knowledge of software vulnerabilities.

The project discloses links to relevant github repositories.

##### Statement from Civil:

In response to “Report of technological audit,” Civil Media Company has engaged ConsenSys Diligence to perform a code audit of its smart contracts, following which the results will be published. The audit is expected to be completed prior to or on or about the start of the token sale.

##### Analysis:

The CVL token is not likened to financial investment on website, whitepaper, or any marketing materials. It is referred to as a consumer token, and the notion that the token should be treated as a security or financial investment is specifically addressed and rejected.

The technical details of the Civil registry as well as an overview of the smart contract design is provided in the Whitepaper. Additionally, details on token supply are included in the Civil website FAQ, and discussed in the analysis for Principle 5. While no pseudocode explanations are present (although an audit of the relevant smart contracts is ongoing), there is an ample amount of detail within the Whitepaper explaining the technical mechanisms by which the ecosystem will operate.

It is not clear which token lockups and vesting schedules for token allocations are governed by smart contracts or by company policy.

All reviewed marketing materials appear consistent with the marketing practices recommended by the Framework and any undetected inconsistencies (if they exist) will likely surface as part of the feedback on this scorecard.

##### Statement from Civil:

In response to “Steps taken to comply with the marketing principles outlined in this document,” Civil Media Company has taken extensive steps, including supporting and responding to this scorecard, to ensure that it markets the CVL token as a consumer token that enables purchasers to participate in the Civil protocol rather than as a financial investment. Civil Media Company has included in its documents and marketing initiatives the fact that CVL tokens are subject to various restrictions, including in its smart contracts, such as proof of use and limiting resales to qualified consumers, that are designed to mitigate speculative and passive secondary trading profits.

##### Analysis:

CVL token holders may stake tokens to appeal to the Civil Council in the event of a malicious attack or mob rule. This Council has the ability to reverse a community decision. However, Council decisions may then be overturned by a “community veto”.

In addition to the ability to submit, challenge, and vote on Civil Registry applications, any CVL token holder has the right to:

- Appeal the result of a Newsroom challenge to the Civil Council by staking a Council Deposit
- Initiate a veto challenge to a Council’s decision by staking a matching Council Deposit
- Propose and challenge changes to Civil’s dynamic parameters by staking a Parameter Deposit
- Propose and challenge amendments to the Civil Constitution by staking an Amendment Deposit
- Initiate a veto challenge to a Council decision regarding an Amendment Proposal by staking a matching Amendment Deposit

In the event that CVL does not meet its minimum funding level, all ETH contributions will be refunded.

##### Statement from Civil:

In response to “Refund measures if project is scaled down,” if the token sale does not hit its ‘soft cap’ during the allotted sale period, then any purchase contributions will be automatically refunded. This process is trustless and will be automated by the smart contracts handling the sale.

After a successful sale, the terms of sale will govern this point. By purchasing CVL, a purchaser acknowledges that neither Civil Media Company, its affiliates, directors nor shareholders are required to provide a refund or allow a cancellation for any reason except as may be required by applicable law or regulation. It may be possible for token holders to resell their tokens to other purchasers who intend to use them and pass the applicable screening requirements; however, there is no guarantee that such resales will be possible or, if they are, that they would allow the token holder to receive the equivalent of a “full refund.”
