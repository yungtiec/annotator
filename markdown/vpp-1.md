# Consumer Token Disclosure (v1)

### Product description

Virtue Poker (VP) plans to offer a blockchain-based online poker service. VP intends to solve the trust issues underlying online poker. Currently, online poker players must put their trust in the entity running the online poker game. By using the blockchain to run the game, the execution of the game is less prone to cheating and provides enhanced security for players.

### User experience

To play on VP, users have to download a desktop client, register on uPort, and fund a light wallet. After that, there’s no real UI difference between blockchain poker and existing online poker. While the underlying mechanics of the client and registration are more complex, the process itself should not be too complicated to deter user uptake.

### Know-your-customer process

Player identity in the form of an Ethereum address will be verified through uPort.

### Protocol description

Ethereum smart contracts handle game registry, hold game money in escrow, and store game data. An “Interplanetary File System” (IFPS) will log all game history - taking advantage of blockchain’s immutable distributed ledgers. Shuffling is a series of randomizations and encryptions that ensures players can see only their cards.

A proof of stake (PoS) consensus method will incentivize players to act as “justices” or nodes.

These justices manage the rake system for VP, staking VPP for the chance to validate transactions and game activity in return for a small percentage of these transactions. The currency VPP can be used for tournaments and as an in-game currency, but is not a claim to the profits of VP itself.

### Market description

The size of the online poker market is estimated at $2.5B per year.

### Token sale date

VP’s token sale is planned for April 25, 2018.

### Token sale cap
For the April 25, 2018 sale, there is a hard cap of $12.5M.
